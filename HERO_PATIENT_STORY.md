# Hero Patient Story: Maria Rodriguez

## Patient Profile

**Name**: Maria Rodriguez  
**Age**: 72 years old  
**Date of Birth**: March 15, 1952  
**Discharge Date**: January 18, 2025 (5 days ago)  
**Diagnosis**: Type 2 Diabetes with Complications (Diabetic Ketoacidosis)  
**Insurance**: Medicare  
**Address**: 456 Mission Hill Ave, Boston, MA 02120  

## The Story

Maria Rodriguez represents the perfect "hero patient" for our healthcare continuity demo because her case embodies all the critical risk factors that make patient leakage both likely and costly.

### Why Maria is High-Risk (Score: 85/100)

**Age Factor (25 points)**: At 72, Maria falls into the highest risk category for post-discharge complications and care abandonment.

**Diagnosis Complexity (30 points)**: Diabetes with complications requires immediate, specialized follow-up. Without proper endocrinology care, she faces:
- Risk of readmission within 30 days
- Potential for diabetic emergencies
- Long-term complications (kidney disease, vision loss, neuropathy)

**Time Sensitivity (20 points)**: 5 days post-discharge with no follow-up scheduled. The critical window for intervention is closing rapidly.

**Geographic Risk (10 points)**: Lives in Mission Hill, a neighborhood with limited specialist access and transportation challenges for elderly patients.

### The Business Impact

**Without Intervention**:
- 65% chance of seeking care outside the network
- Estimated revenue loss: $18,500 per year
- Potential readmission cost: $12,000+
- Long-term relationship loss: $45,000+ lifetime value

**With Our Solution**:
- Immediate identification as highest priority
- Perfect provider match in under 30 seconds
- Referral sent same day
- Patient retained in network

## Demo Narrative Arc

### Act 1: The Problem (Dashboard View)
"Here's Brenda's Monday morning reality. She's looking at 47 discharged patients, but Maria Rodriguez immediately catches her attention - risk score 85, critical priority. Without our system, Maria would be buried in a spreadsheet somewhere."

### Act 2: The Investigation (Patient Detail)
"Let's see why Maria is high-risk. 72 years old, diabetic, 5 days post-discharge with no endocrinology follow-up scheduled. This is exactly the type of patient who ends up in the ER at another hospital."

### Act 3: The Solution (Provider Matching)
"Instead of Brenda spending 45 minutes researching endocrinologists, our AI finds the perfect match instantly. Dr. Sarah Chen at Boston Medical Center - 94% match score, 12 minutes from Maria's home, takes Medicare, available this week."

### Act 4: The Resolution (Referral Sent)
"One click, referral sent. Maria gets the care she needs, stays in our network, and Brenda can move on to the next patient. What used to take an hour now takes 2 minutes."
