# Task Verification: Replace mock data with `usePatient` hook

## Task Summary
**Task 3.2: Patient Detail View Updates - Replace mock data with `usePatient` hook**

## Requirements Addressed
This task addresses Requirements 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, and 5.4 from the requirements document.

## Implementation Details

### ✅ Requirement 2.1: Navigation to detailed patient view
- **Implementation**: Dashboard component now uses `PatientDetailContainer` which accepts a `patientId`
- **Verification**: When a patient is clicked in the dashboard, the system navigates to the detailed view using the patient ID

### ✅ Requirement 2.2: Display comprehensive patient information
- **Implementation**: `usePatient` hook fetches complete patient data from Supabase database
- **Enhanced data**: Includes computed fields like age, days since discharge, and detailed risk factors
- **Verification**: Patient detail view shows demographics, diagnosis, insurance, location, and risk analysis

### ✅ Requirement 2.4: Handle incomplete patient data gracefully
- **Implementation**: `PatientDetailContainer` includes comprehensive error handling
- **Missing data handling**: System clearly indicates when patient data is incomplete or missing
- **Verification**: Proper error states for missing patients, network failures, and incomplete data

### ✅ Requirement 5.4: Maintain application state appropriately
- **Implementation**: Navigation state is properly managed between dashboard and patient detail views
- **State preservation**: Dashboard state is maintained when returning from patient detail view
- **Verification**: Back navigation works correctly and preserves dashboard filters/search

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Dashboard Component Updates
```typescript
// Before: Direct use of PatientDetailView
<PatientDetailView patient={selectedPatient} onBack={() => setSelectedPatient(null)} />

// After: Use of PatientDetailContainer with patient ID
<PatientDetailContainer patientId={selectedPatient.id} onBack={() => setSelectedPatient(null)} />
```

### 2. PatientDetailContainer Implementation
- **Loading States**: Comprehensive loading skeleton while fetching patient data
- **Error Handling**: Specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- **Not Found Handling**: Graceful handling when patient ID doesn't exist
- **Data Transformation**: Proper integration with enhanced patient data from `usePatient` hook

### 3. usePatient Hook Integration
- **Real-time Updates**: Supabase subscription for live data updates
- **Enhanced Data**: Risk calculations and computed fields
- **Error Recovery**: Retry mechanisms and proper error propagation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

## Verification Checklist

### ✅ Core Functionality
- [x] Dashboard uses PatientDetailContainer instead of PatientDetailView directly
- [x] PatientDetailContainer properly uses usePatient hook
- [x] Patient data is fetched from Supabase database (not mock data)
- [x] Enhanced patient data includes computed fields (age, days since discharge, risk factors)

### ✅ Error Handling
- [x] Loading states with skeleton UI
- [x] Error states with helpful messages
- [x] Not found states for missing patients
- [x] Network failure recovery options
- [x] Graceful handling of incomplete data

### ✅ User Experience
- [x] Smooth navigation between dashboard and patient detail
- [x] Proper back navigation functionality
- [x] State preservation when navigating
- [x] Real-time data updates (when enabled)

### ✅ Code Quality
- [x] TypeScript compilation without errors
- [x] Build process successful
- [x] Proper React hooks usage (fixed conditional hook call)
- [x] Clean separation of concerns

## Requirements Compliance

### Requirement 2.1 ✅
**"WHEN I click on a patient from the dashboard THEN the system SHALL navigate to a detailed patient view"**
- Implementation: Dashboard onClick handler sets selectedPatient, triggering PatientDetailContainer render

### Requirement 2.2 ✅
**"WHEN the patient detail view loads THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive patient information"**
- Implementation: usePatient hook fetches complete patient data with enhanced fields

### Requirement 2.4 ✅
**"WHEN patient data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate missing information"**
- Implementation: PatientDetailContainer handles missing data scenarios with appropriate UI feedback

### Requirement 5.4 ✅
**"WHEN I navigate between views THEN the system SHALL maintain application state appropriately"**
- Implementation: Dashboard state preserved during navigation, proper cleanup on component unmount

## Testing Results

### Build Verification ✅
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ built in 6.12s - No errors
```

### TypeScript Verification ✅
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
# No compilation errors
```

### Functional Testing ✅
- Patient data transformation works correctly
- Error handling functions as expected
- Component integration maintains type safety
- Real-time updates supported

## Conclusion

The task "Replace mock data with `usePatient` hook" has been successfully implemented with:

1. **Complete replacement** of mock data with real Supabase database integration
2. **Enhanced error handling** for all failure scenarios
3. **Improved user experience** with proper loading and error states
4. **Full compliance** with requirements 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, and 5.4
5. **Maintainable code** with proper TypeScript support and clean architecture

The implementation is production-ready and provides a solid foundation for the remaining tasks in the healthcare continuity MVP.
