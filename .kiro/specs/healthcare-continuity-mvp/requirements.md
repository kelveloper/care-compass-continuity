# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Healthcare Continuity MVP is a web application designed to help care coordinators efficiently identify and refer high-risk patients to appropriate healthcare providers. The system addresses the critical problem of patient leakage by providing intelligent risk assessment, provider matching, and streamlined referral workflows. The primary user is Brenda, a care coordinator who needs to quickly identify patients at risk of leaving the network and find suitable providers for their care needs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a care coordinator, I want to see a prioritized dashboard of patients based on their leakage risk, so that I can focus my attention on the most critical cases first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display all patients from the database
2. WHEN patients are displayed THEN the system SHALL calculate and show a leakage risk score for each patient
3. WHEN patients are listed THEN the system SHALL sort them by risk score in descending order (highest risk first)
4. WHEN a patient has a high risk score THEN the system SHALL visually highlight them with appropriate styling
5. IF a patient has missing critical data THEN the system SHALL still calculate a risk score using available information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a care coordinator, I want to view detailed patient information, so that I can understand their specific care needs and circumstances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a patient from the dashboard THEN the system SHALL navigate to a detailed patient view
2. WHEN the patient detail view loads THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive patient information including demographics, diagnosis, insurance, and location
3. WHEN viewing patient details THEN the system SHALL show the calculated risk factors that contribute to their leakage risk
4. WHEN patient data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate missing information
5. IF patient data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a care coordinator, I want to find the best provider matches for a patient, so that I can make informed referral decisions quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I initiate a provider search from the patient detail view THEN the system SHALL prompt for the required service type
2. WHEN I specify a service type THEN the system SHALL find and rank providers based on multiple matching criteria
3. WHEN provider matches are found THEN the system SHALL display the top 3 recommendations with detailed information
4. WHEN providers are ranked THEN the system SHALL consider specialty match, geographic proximity, insurance acceptance, and availability
5. WHEN no suitable providers are found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message with alternative suggestions
6. IF the matching algorithm fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options or error handling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a care coordinator, I want to track referral status, so that I can monitor the progress of patient care transitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a provider for referral THEN the system SHALL allow me to initiate the referral process
2. WHEN a referral is initiated THEN the system SHALL update the patient's status to reflect the pending referral
3. WHEN referral status changes THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to confirm the action
4. WHEN viewing a patient with active referrals THEN the system SHALL display the current referral status
5. IF referral tracking fails THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and notify the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a care coordinator, I want the system to be responsive and reliable, so that I can efficiently manage my workflow without technical interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform any action THEN the system SHALL respond within 3 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL provide visual loading indicators
3. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages and recovery options
4. WHEN I navigate between views THEN the system SHALL maintain application state appropriately
5. WHEN using the application on different devices THEN the system SHALL provide a consistent, responsive experience

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to integrate with Supabase database, so that patient and provider data is persistently stored and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL successfully connect to the Supabase database
2. WHEN patient data is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve current information from the patients table
3. WHEN provider data is needed THEN the system SHALL query the providers table with appropriate filters
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide user feedback
5. WHEN data is modified THEN the system SHALL ensure data consistency and integrity
6. IF database connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection and notify users of any service disruption
